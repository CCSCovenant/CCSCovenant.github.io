Working with various of computer vision projects in the industry manufacturing:  
ongoing research project:  correct fabric misalignment and distortion on a production line during the  
process of gluing fabric to shoe soles with camera.  
  
## Estimation of the 3D Rim of an Object from its 2D occluding contours  
### Elder lab, York University, Toronto  
#### May 2023 - August 2023  

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof James.H.Elder in this project as part of Lassonde Undergradute Research Award. project details and report can be find [here](https://3d-rim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

long in short, this research aims to explore how common object regularities and projection rules might facilitate statistical shape estimations from occluding contours, even in the absence of strict quantitative links

## Work/study position: SARIT Project  
### Elder lab, York University, Toronto  
#### May 2022 - April 2023  

This project aimed to deploy a low-cost, vision-based pedestrian detection system on SARIT
